## Description
This is a web-based text editor designed as a one-page application, accessible directly from your browser. The application meets Progressive Web App (PWA) criteria and incorporates a range of data persistence methods. These techniques provide backup solutions in case a particular option isn't compatible with the browser. Moreover, the application can be installed and is functional while offline, allowing usability regardless of your internet connection.
